# Portfolio Marcin Piasecki

## This project was made to get to know me, present my skills and gather all my projects in one webpage.

### In this website I used:
* HTML, 
* CSS3, 
* JavaScript ES6,
* a little bit of jQuery. 


### Project contains:
* RWD,
* Three language versions - my skills,
* Menu hamburger - JS,
* Automatic jump to chosen section - jQuery,
* Keyframes and media queries
* Sending forms - via hosting

## Project may be considered done but due to my constant develop I add further websites to it.
